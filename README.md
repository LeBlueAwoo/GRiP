GRiP is an acronym for Graphical Randomness in Python and, as the name suggests, 
is a compilation of (reasonably) useful programs all written in Python.

Included:
* Terminal emulator
* Clock
* Calculator
...and more!

To run these, you will need the latest version of Python (though not necessarily IDLE)
and the TkInter library for Python. That's all you need, as GRiP, when run, will install any missing modules automatically.

For instructions, install GRiP and open 'Documentation' in 
'Start Menu -> GRiP -> Documentation'

NOTES:
* Don't try running the .py files from IDLE, as you are likely to encounter graphical glitches.
* Don't open the Source_Code folder unless you know what you're doing!
* Though GRiP can be downloaded using the 'git clone' command on Linux operating systems, it was only designed to be run on Windows and Windows compatibles (EG: React OS, etc.). If you really must run GRiP on Linux though, then I'd advise waiting until I've properly ported it (at some point in July)
* It's come to my attention that certain anti-malware programs see the GRiP installer as a malicious file. If yours does, just tell it GRiP means your computer no harm! I have way better things to do with my time than give a whole new meaning to cyber-bullying!

Enjoy!
