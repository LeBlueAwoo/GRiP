GRiP is an acronym for Graphical Randomness in Python and, as the name suggests, 
is a compilation of (reasonably) useful programs all written in Python.

Included:
* Terminal emulator
* Clock
* Calculator
...and more!

To run these, you will need the latest version of Python (though not necessarily IDLE)
and the TkInter library for Python. That's all you need, as GRiP, when run, will install any missing modules automatically.

For instructions, install GRiP and open 'Documentation' in 
'Start Menu -> GRiP -> Documentation'

NOTE: Don't try running the .py files from IDLE, as you are likely to encounter graphical glitches.
OTHER NOTE: Don't open the Source_Code folder unless you know what you're doing!

Enjoy!
